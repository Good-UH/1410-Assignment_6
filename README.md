Program that stores any number of integers in a dynamic array

Write a program that uses a dynamic array that can grow when there is not enough space in the array to store a new element.
Static arrays, you must specify the size of the array (int list[5]) and the size cannot change. To overcome this limitation,
one solution is to use pointers to create dynamic arrays. Write a program that can store any number of integers in a dynamic array.
Assume the user will always enter proper type value (integer).
